SiamCi integration prototype
Created 2/9/2011
Carlos Rueda - MBARI

This is the SIAM-CI integration prototype.

STATUS: Working initial proof-of-concept prototype. It involves interaction with services in the python 
capability container to support instrument driver interface operations. It is in no way exhaustive
and the current design is just preliminary.
